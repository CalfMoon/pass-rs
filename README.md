# pass-rs
A simple password manager written in rust.

_NOTE: This program is not really made to be used seriously.
Although I hope it works I will keep using [gnu pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) as it is better and more well maintained.
This is more of a tool for me to learn a systems level language and I thought the project of this level is of perfect difficulty._
